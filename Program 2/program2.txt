Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare add_count, subtract_count, multiply_count, divide_count

Step 3: Initialize variables
    add_count = 0
    subtract_count = 0
    multiply_count = 0
    divide_count = 0

FIXME Step #: Define program functions

In this programming assignment, you will create a simple calculator program that allows users to
perform basic arithmetic operations. You will use branching (if-else) statements and iteration
(loops) to implement the calculator's functionalities.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Display Menu
Your program should display a menu of available operations.
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division

2. User Input
Prompt the user to select an operation by entering the corresponding number from
the menu (See sample output)

3. Perform Calculation
Based on the user's choice, perform the selected operation on two numbers
entered by the user.

4. Display Result:
Display the result of the calculation to the user.

5. Repeat or Exit:
After displaying the result, ask the user if they want to perform another calculation:
    - If yes, repeat the process.
    - If not:
        - Display the total number of operations the user performed and display the used operation
          and the number of times it was used. (See Sample Output).
        - Then exit the program.

Requirements:
    - Use a loop to repeatedly allow the user to perform calculations until they choose to exit.
    - Implement branching (if-else) statements to handle different operations.
    - Need to validate user input (See Sample output).
    - Handle division by zero:
        - If the denominator is zero, program needs to ask the user to renter another
          value.
        - Program will apply division once the user enters nonzero number.
    - Include comments to explain the purpose of different parts of your code.
