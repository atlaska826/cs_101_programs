------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program allows the user to answer 3 quiz questions, and outputs their correct answer percentage as many times as
they would like. The questions are randomized every time the user plays.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Start

Step 2: Import random module

Step 3: Initialize variable correct_count and set = 0

Step 4: Initialize the list, questions, a list of 3 dictionaries with key/values...
    (Do following three times with each dictionary a separate list item)
    4.1: 'question': 'Question',
    4.2: 'options': ['a)', 'b)', 'c)', 'd)'],
    4.3: 'correct_answer': correction option index as an int

Step 5: Declare randomize_questions()
    5.1: Create an empty_list order
    5.2: For loop that runs 3 times
        5.2.1: Sets num = a random integer between 0 and 2 (inclusive)
        5.2.2: Repeats above step while num is in order list
        5.2.3: Appends num to order
    5.3: Returns order list

Step 6: Declare ask_question(int question_num, int index)
    6.1: Create a list, accepted_answers, with the value of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'
    6.2: Set question to the value of questions[index]
    6.3: Output the question
    6.4: Loop through the 'options' list and output each option on a new line
    6.5: Set user_answer = user input (case-insensitive)
    6.6: While user_answer not in accepted_answers
        6.6.1: Output error message to the user
        6.6.2: Ask the user to input their answer again
    6.7: If index of user_answer in accepted_answers == question['correct_answer']
            Output correct answer message
         Else
            Output incorrect answer message

Step 7: Declare play_again()
    7.1: Set quiz_again to user input
    7.2: While quiz_again (not case-sensitive) is not equal to 'yes' or 'no'
            Output error message to user
            Set quiz_again to user input
    7.3: If quiz_again is 'yes'
            return True
         Else
            return False

Step 8: Print greeting to user

Step 9: Repeat steps until loop is terminated (while True)
    9.1: Set question_order = Return of randomize_questions()
    9.2: Set question_count = 1
    9.3: Iterate through question_order
        9.3.1: Call ask_question with the arguments question_count and the iteration value
        9.3.2: If return value of above step is True
                  Increment correct_count by 1
        9.3.2: Increment question_count by 1

    9.4: Output user's score as a percentage

    9.5: Ask user if they want to play again
        9.5.1: Set play_again to return value of play_again()
        9.5.2: If play_again is False
                  break (ends while loop)
               Set correct_count = 0 (runs if loop is not terminated)
               Output a blank line

Step 10: Print goodbye message to user

Step 11: Stop
